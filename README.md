I working on this project to help an organization to extract uselful information from its sales data and to present the data in an easy to analuze format.
In this project we need to give an input file contianing the sales data. Then the program will read the data and store it.
After that it will calculate total sales for each month, most selling product, which product generated most revenue and which item is most popular each month.
In this project I have used data structures like Arraylists and Hashmaps and OOPs concepts.
