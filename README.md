# Sales-Calculator #
I created this project which will help an organization to extract uselful information from its sales data and to present the data in an easy to analyze format.
In this project we give the input as a file contianing the sales data. Then the program will read the data and store it.
After that it will calculate total sales for each month, most selling product, which product generated most revenue and which item is most popular each month.
In this project I have used data structures like Arraylists and Hashmaps and OOPs concepts.

## Working ##
A program that reads data and reports:

1. Total sales of the store.
2. Month wise sales totals.
3. Most popular item (most quantity sold) in each month.
4. Items generating most revenue in each month.
5. For the most popular item, find the min, max and average number of orders each month.

## Input CSV Format ##
Date,Item,Unit Price,Quantity,Total Price

Examples:
2019-01-01,Vanilla Single Scoop,50,5,250 
2019-01-01,Cake Fudge,150,5,750 
2019-01-01,Hot Chocolate Fudge,120,3,360

**Note:** Program reads input from a CSV file.
